# DragonCliffCalc
Some Calculators for the game Dragon Cliff 龙崖


This is a Python version where you can look up attack, crit and average damage of an attack via console.

Usage: run calculator.py with the specific arguments.

Example:

Input:
python calculator.py --character "Street Man" --main_stat 4000 --attack_level 9 --crit 0.6 --crit_damage 6 --dmg_enhance 0.9

Output:
{Character Info}

Attack Damage:     45600

Critical Damage:  273600

Average Damage:   182400

Only a proof of concept. Not sure if I will add more functionality as a compiled program with a database and a GUI will be better suited.
